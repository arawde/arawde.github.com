          <p>
            My name is Avery, and I'm a 24 year old software developer living in Vancouver, BC, CA.
            I graduated from the University of British Columbia in 2019, with a BA in computer science and a minor in philosophy.
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm primarily interested in the design and construction of distributed systems and the challenges they present.
            In philosophy, I'm curious about the relationship between how we acquire language and how we acquire ideas. 
            Outside of my work and studies, I like talking about finance, music, aesthetics, and chess.

        <h3><a href="http://bgcengineering.ca" title="BGC Engineering">BGC Engineering</a></h3>
        <p>I currently work as a full-stack developer at BGC Engineering, a geosciences firm based in Vancouver, Canada.
        My work primarily focuses on building and maintaining systems which consume geohazard information and provide relevant advisory services to our clients. 
        We consume data from agencies such as the US Geological Survey, Natural Resources Canada, and Environment Canada, as well as geospatial datasets, 
        such as river networks, which encompass over 18 million stream and river segments.</p>
        <p>I work on tools which help mitigate the effects that seismic events, heavy rainfall, flooding, 
        and other geological events have on existing and planned infrastructure. I get to work with engineers and geoscientists,
        and help our company provide important guidance to energy, mining, and rail clients. I mostly work with C# and Typescript codebases.</p>
        <h3>OnDemand Solutions</h3>
        <p>I worked as a full stack developer at OnDemand Solutions from 2015 to 2019. In my role, I focused on constructing
        APIs which were consumed by web clients built by my colleagues. In the process, I learned about new features in ES6, some of the
        fundamentals of web development in Go, and worked with Postgres and MS SQL.</p>

          <br />
          <p>I graduated from the University of British Columbia in 2019 with a BA in Computer Science and a minor in philosophy</p>
          <p>I started at UBC in the Arts faculty, intending to study economics. I found it wasn't for me, and switched to computer
          science, since I had prior experience from high school. I focused on language design, networking, and distributed systems
          in classes outside of the core data structures, algorithms, and hardware curriculum.</p>
          <p>My dive into philosophy began in second year, with a class on philosophy of literature. I went on to take classes on topics
          from language, to art, to religion, and existentialism.</p>

          <p>When I'm not working, I have a few things which I enjoy spending my time doing. My primary interest is finance - I love reading about it,
          I love talking about it, and I like participating in it. My favorite financial column to read is <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/authors/ARbTQlRLRjE/matthew-s-levine">Matt Levine's</a> <a href="http://link.mail.bloombergbusiness.com/join/4wm/moneystuff-signup&hash=54223001ca3ffcf40f2629c25acea67a">Money Stuff</a>, which does an amazing job of exploring the intricacies of modern financial markets.</p>
          <p>While I'm at my computer, I'll occasionally play video games with my friends, but I also like to play chess. I started playing when
          I was in elementary school, with my father teaching me. During middle school, I was in my school's chess club. I stopped playing in high
          school, when video games became a more prominent part of my life, but I have since started playing again. You can <a href="https://lichess.org/@/arawde">challenge me to a game on Lichess</a> if you want!</p>
          <p>My last big interest is music. I'm the sort of person who really doesn't like to have quiet in my life, and music is also one of the ways
          that I deal with some of the frustrations of every day life. As a result, I've recently started playing guitar. In addition, my recent re-introduction to the electronic music scene has inspired me to start making rudimentary DJ sets on my computer. It's hard for me to articulate what electronic music I like, so it's probably best if you just <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLBCfjOgXPjE-kq2V3H_5XwEmyIuWvurQi">check out a small collection of DJ sets</a> that I've started to compile recently.</p>
