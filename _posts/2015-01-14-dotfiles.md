What is there to be said about dotfiles? It's a great way to see into someones 
work environment.  

Screenshot:
![Current setup](/assets/scrot.png)

Shown:  
- ncmpcpp  
- firefox  
- tmux  
- weechat  
- vim (featuring airline & NERDTree)  

The window manager is bspwm, which I find has very good dual monitor support 
compared to, say, awesome or herbstluftwm. 

You can find the entirety of the dotfiles over at my [Gitub repo](http://github.com/arawde/dotfiles)
